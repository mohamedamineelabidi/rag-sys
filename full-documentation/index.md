# Tutorial: rag-sys

This project is a **smart document assistant** that lets you *chat with your own files*, like PDFs and Word documents. You first run a script to process and index your documents into a specialized vector database. Afterwards, you can ask questions in plain English through a web application, and the system will find the most relevant information in your files to generate a detailed, accurate answer.
